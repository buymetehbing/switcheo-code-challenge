## About me üëãüèº

Hi there, I'm Vivienne Ching, a penultimate year undergrad studying computer science and economics at NTU. To me, software development is an area that truly excites me as it provides me with a canvas to express my creativity while simultaneously challenging my problem-solving skills. My journey in this field has been enriched with diverse experiences and I've undertaken internships covering software development and project management. On top of that, I've also accomplished the publication of my own iOS application. For more about me, do check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivienneching/) :-)
